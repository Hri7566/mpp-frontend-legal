# mpp-frontend-v1

Original site files for [MPP](https://multiplayerpiano.com).

The original site is no longer with us anymore. This repository contains the latest official site files given to us by Brandon Lockaby, the creator of Multiplayer Piano. He no longer owns the site.

This repository was created by the new owner of Multiplayer Piano, who hasn't done jack shit with the site.

I heavily encourage anyone here to instead use [MPPClone](https://mppclone.com) ([public files on github](https://github.com/LapisHusky/mppclone)) as it is now the main server (even the main site uses it!), which was created by our good friend [Lapis](https://github.com/LapisHusky). There are many differences for the better of the community.
